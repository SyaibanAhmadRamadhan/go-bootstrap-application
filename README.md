# GO SERVICE BOOTSTRAP

A starter template for building internal backend services.  
This repository provides a ready-to-use project layout, wiring, and tooling so you don’t have to set up everything from scratch for every new service.

It’s designed for a “distributed monolith” style architecture: many services, one database, with clear ownership and strict API contracts between services.
